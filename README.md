Semikron, a German manufacturer of power semiconductor components, said on Monday that its internal network had been hit by ransomware. According to a sample of the ransomware used in the attack that was later uploaded on VirusTotal, the attack appears to have been carried out by the LV ransomware gang, considered an offshoot of the now-defunct REvil gang.
